YOU:  I have a question, if I am about to colleterate my ETH to get DAI, meaning the DAI will be newly issued on the smart contract, meanwhile increase the total supply of DAI, but when I returned my DAI to get back the colleterated ETH, what will happend to the DAI? Will it be burned?

DOC 411: When you collateralize your ETH to generate DAI, the DAI is newly issued on the smart contract, which increases the total supply of DAI. However, when you return your DAI to get back the collateralized ETH, the DAI will not be burned. Instead, you will need to repay the DAI you generated plus any accrued interest or fees. The DAI you repay will be taken out of circulation, but it will not be burned.

YOU: Anyone know how can we manage ds proxy contract ? Any web interface?

DOC 411: There is no specific web interface available to manage the ds proxy contract. The ds proxy contract is owned individually by users and is intended to be used programmatically by developers to interact with the Maker Protocol. However, there may be third-party applications or platforms that provide a web interface for managing the ds proxy contract.

YOU: Hello, I accidentally transferred my dai to the dai contract address, how  I get help?

DOC 411: If you accidentally transferred your DAI to the DAI contract address, you can try reaching out to the support team at [email protected] for assistance. They may be able to help you recover your funds or provide guidance on what steps to take next.

YOU: hey everyone - does MakerDAO have a current grant program? From what I can find it looks like the old one was moth balled.

DOC 411: Based on the provided context, there is no information about a grant program for MakerDAO. Therefore, it is unclear whether MakerDAO currently has a grant program or if the old one has been discontinued.

YOU: Quick question, but where do I go to find out the interest rate if I wanted to take out a loan denominated in Dai?

DOC 411: To find information about the interest rate for taking out a loan denominated in Dai, you can check the Dai Savings Rate (DSR). The DSR is the annual savings rate that Dai holders can earn by locking their Dai into the DSR contract. You can use the function `getYearlyRate()` to get the current annual savings rate. Additionally, you can visit the Oasis.app platform, which allows users to activate the Dai Savings Rate and earn savings on their Dai holdings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YOU: i'm not interested in earning an interest by locking my DAI, quite the opposite, I want to know how much interest I will pay if I take out a loan in DAI

DOC 411: To find out the interest rate for taking out a loan denominated in DAI, you can use the `getYearlyRate()` method provided by the `mcd:savings` service. This method will return the current annual savings rate, which can be considered as the interest rate for borrowing DAI.

YOU: Hello. My vault  was liquidated, then I can reclaim remaining WBTC. But even when I click the "Reclaim collateral" button on the oasis.app page, I can't make it.( keep loading...and status doesn't change)  .  Would you let me know how to deal with it?

DOC 411: If you are unable to reclaim your remaining WBTC after your vault was liquidated on the oasis.app page, you can proceed to the migration portal and follow the outlined emergency redemption process. The migration portal will provide instructions on how to claim your excess collateral or migrate to a newly deployed system. Make sure to check if the oasis.app page has integrated the redemption process. If not, transfer to the migration portal if possible.

YOU: At what collateral ratio does a vault get liquidated? I’m having trouble understanding how the liquidation process works. I’m also having some trouble understanding the “costs” part, And why it’s so high? (45million if I understand that right)

DOC 411: The collateral ratio at which a Vault gets liquidated is determined by the liquidation ratio. The liquidation ratio is a specific risk parameter approved by MKR holders for each type of collateral. It determines the amount of overcollaterization a Vault requires to avoid liquidation. For example, if the liquidation ratio is 150%, then the value of the collateral must always be one and a half times the value of the Dai generated. If the value of the collateral falls below the liquidation ratio, then the Vault becomes unsafe and is liquidated by the system.
